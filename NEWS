v0.1            This is the first official release of make-it-quick.

    This alpha-quality version provides most of the basic functions I
    think are useful to develop C / C++ software on Linux and macOS. This
    was not extensively tested on any other platform at this point,
    although some effort was made to ensure it would not be gratuitously
    broken.
